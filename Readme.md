# Easy Paint

Hereby you can see the first computer graphics school project. This is a smal utility program where you can draw simple shapes. 

Program made by a Higher School of Economics University (Moscow) student - Sergey Pavlov. 
You are free to use any code you find in this solution in all kinds of projects including commercial ones.

## Seminar 1
Simple line, circle and ellipse building. Color picker and clearing the screen included.

## Seminar 2
Polyline drawing. Filling the screen with a seed pixel and by applying to a geometry shape - also being complicated ones represented by unapplied trivial ones (except line).  
Color pickers number extended to 3: contours, filling and background colors.  
Two buffers implemented: short and long one. Both collect the values of replaced pixels at the time of drawing.  
The first one aims to show the objects in real-time while they're being drawn.  
The long one stands for the drawn, but not applied figures. It is going to be used later to change the sizes of the objects.  
You can crop unapplied lines by using "transform" menu node.
